# v4

- Configuration file can now also be a YAML file
- Configuration file renames `pipeline:` to `pipelines:`
- Step `download-file` is removed. Use `pipelines/destinations`.
  If you run queries after `download-file`, make multiple pipelines instead.
- Step `delay` is removed.
- Step `sparql` is split into `sparql-update` and `sparql-query`.
  The former performs a `INSERT`, `DELETE` to the (POST) SPARQL endpoint,
  the latter is meant for `CONSTRUCT` or `DESCRIBE` to the SPARQL endpoint.
  (`SELECT`, `ASK` don't make sense in the context of a RDF set)
- Step `shacl-validate` is added.
  This step provides SHACL validation to locally constructed triples.
  SHACL errors are fatal (i.e., stop pipeline execution).
  On the CLI, the option `--warnings-as-errors/-e` makes SHACL warnings fatal.
  SHACL information-level messages are posted to stdout.
- On the CLI, the subcommand `rules` collects the construct queries as SHACL rules.
- Step `import-msaccess` is removed. This has been replaced with a `pipelines/source`
- Destination `sparql-graph-store` is the W3C Recommendation [SPARQL 1.1 Graph Store][gs].
  Destination `sparql-quad-store` is not standardized, but is similar to the Graph Store protocol,
  but with Dataset semantics. I.e., multiple contexts can be passed and quads can be uploaded.
- Backend updates to prepare for RDF 1.2 support with quoted triples.
- TODO: Remote files are automatically downloaded by the query runner.
- New GeoPackage source
