# `local-file-to-laces`

To use `@stichting-crow/laces-hub-js`, the library used by this step, it's required to include either a `.env` file in the project root, or provide the following as environment variables.

```conf
LACES_ENDPOINT_URI=https://hub.laces.tech
LACES_APP_ID=2d27d434-9b26-46a5-aa2e-17c48e2a6deb
LACES_APP_PWD=59c5edb6-49f3-4671-aab6-78c575d5fc54
```

(These are, of course, example values.)
